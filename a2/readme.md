## Compilation

1. Open terminal in the a2 folder directory

2. If a bin directory is not already present create a bin directory

3. Type make

4. Type ./a2 to run the program. Hope you like it !

## After running ./a2
**P11 & P12**: These will execute automatically (no need for user to do anything)

**P21**: This one will prompt the user for two floating point numbers twice. One for point s1 and one for s2. You must enter the first number, press space once, then enter the second number and press enter. Repeat this process for s2 prompt.

**P22**: This was discussed in limitations. But P22 will only compute the convex hull of the data using quick hull and print out the points accordingly.

## Data Files

- To run the program the data files must placed into the data directory. If the data directory is not already present create a new directory called "data".
- As it states in the assignment description, I have hard coded the names of the data files as given. The two file names to be used in the program are "data_A2_Q1.txt" and "data_A2_Q2.txt".
- The data in both files must be in the same ordered set as given with the assignment.
  - data_A2_Q1.txt must have 5 integers per line, each integer a space apart.
  - data_A2_Q2.txt must have 2 floats per line, each float being a space apart.

## Limitations
  This function can perform all algorithms as given as long as constraints and proper data file conventions are followed
